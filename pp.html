    This policy applies only to information we collect in our app and in e-mail, text and other
    electronic communications sent through or in connection with our app. This policy does not apply
    to information that we collect offline, information collected in other apps or websites
    (including third party apps or websites you may access through our app), or information
    collected by any third party. These third parties may have their own privacy policies, which we

    from the device(s) on which you have downloaded it.

    your settings and preferences in the app will only stay on your phone. <br /><br />

    Third party information collection and use for online behavioral advertising.<br /><br />

    When you use the app on an Android mobile device, certain third parties may use automatic
    information collection technologies to collect information about you or your device. These third
    parties may include advertisers, ad networks, ad servers, and analytics companies. The Company
    provides the advertising ID generated by the Android mobile device (which is a non-persistent
    identifier of your device that you can reset at any time) and may also provide real-time
    location data, usage data, or other information related to your use of the app (but will not
    provide your name, mobile number, or other PII) to these third-party ad servers or ad networks

    when you use the app. Advertisers may collect information about online activities over time and
    across different apps and other online services under a specific advertising ID. Advertisers may
    use this information (including the information we provide to them) to provide interest-based
    (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content to your mobile device.<br /><br />
    We do not control advertisers’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any
    questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should consult the respective
    privacy policies of the advertisers. The Company privacy policy does not apply to such
    advertisers.<br /><br />
